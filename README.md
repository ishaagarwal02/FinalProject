# FinalProject
Welcome to our CS 171 final project on college admissions! 

We were interested in de-mystifying college admissions by visualizing college admissions data for numerous universities across the country. Typically, it is very difficult to find consolidated information on college admissions to make informed decisions about the undergraduate application process. 

In this project, we used two different datasets we found online that had compiled information about 1000+ universities, including average test scores, demographics, locations, average earnings, type of university, size, etc. of every college. We cleaned this data using Python to compile the different data across the two datasets by colleges and eliminate redundancies. We additionally used a Leaflet library to create a dynamic map.  

The code should run automatically using our publicly hosted GitHub link https://ishaagarwal02.github.io/FinalProject/, or you can download the code to Webstorm or another IDE and run it via the index.html page. We recommend using Google Chrome on a laptop for best results, however any browser will work.
